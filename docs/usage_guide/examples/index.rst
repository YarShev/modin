Modin Usage Examples
====================

This section shows Modin usage examples in different scenarios like Modin on a local/remote cluster,
Modin in the cloud, the use of Modin spreadsheet and whatnot. First of all you may want to look at the basic
Modin usage examples in tutorial_ directory. Then, you can check the use of Modin in different real benchmarks:

* `NYC Taxi`_
* Census
* Plasticc

Next, you likely want to visit cluster_ folder to take a look at how to run Modin in the cloud.

Finally, you could look at Modin experimental features usage.
